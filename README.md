# NBA Shot Data Analysis


## Presentation

This repository contains the code for our NBA Shot Data Analysis project, developed during our [Data Scientist training](https://datascientest.com/en/data-scientist-course) at [DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/).

Data collection and analysis has become an integral part of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is linked to the evolution of basketball as a sport in general. Players, teams or shot related data is collected, compiled and processed at an increasingly growing rate in order to better understand and improve player performance and game results. 

The goals of this project is to construct and apply a Machine Learning model to estimate the probability of success of individual NBA shots as a function of numerous shot and player specific features, such as distance, shot type, player shooting efficiency, etc.


This project was developed by the following team :

Selim KNEDIF, Giovanni MINGHELLI, Raphael SADOUN

- Raphael Sadoun (https://github.com/Raphael-Sadoun / https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-sadoun/)

You can browse and run the [notebooks](./notebooks). You will need to install the dependencies (in a dedicated environment) :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Streamlit App

**Add explanations on how to use the app.**

To run the app :

```shell
cd streamlit_app
conda create --name my-awesome-streamlit python=3.9
conda activate my-awesome-streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should then be available at [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
